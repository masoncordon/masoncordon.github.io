    <i>Me grilling on a camping trip in July. This was taken about 20 minutes before I set the grill on fire.</i>
        <p>I love to program, and the problem solving aspect of coding especially is what I fell in love with.
             While I am not very experienced in coding, I have been taking classes on programming and doing my absolute best to focus my education around that since I began high school. I took every CS class I could, and eventually graduated High School with an Associate's Degree.
              I like playing video games as a hobby, I mostly play Marvel Rivals at the moment, but I also play PEAK, Helldivers 2, Mario Kart World, DK Bananza, and Minecraft.
             My favorite language so far is C++, but I do also enjoy Python. HTML is not a favorite for me, but I'm sure I will learn to love it in time.
             I am developing this website as a way to showcase my JavaScript projects, and am very excited to learn JS. I also plan to make this website a sort of pet project of mine, making it as impressive-looking as possible as the months progress.</p>
